# Project_Asamaco

For this project, I did something related to temperature data again. This time I used ODE integration to show how Global Warming has slowly made our planet uninhabitable.

I used a climate model that I found from a text called "Energy Balancing Models" by Daniel Flath, Hans G. Kaper, Frank Wattenberg, Esther Widiasih, to show theoretically how the worlds temperature might have changed from before the industrial revolution to modern day and how it might change in teh future depending on what actions we might take.
